                I have always been interested in understanding how far can Artificial intelligence (AI) 
                really go. "Will robots take over the world, or will man-kind stay at the top of the food chain". 
                  As a curious college student I was able to satisfy my curiosity throughout trial and error by 
                to creating my own projects using the coding language python. From school, personal training, 
                and the New Apprenticeship Data Analyst boot-camp, I have been able to increase my skill-set on 
                daily. I am hungry, and eager to start my professional career, not for the money, but for the 
                soul reason that this is something I seriously enjoy. </p>
